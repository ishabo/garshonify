## Garshonize 

A function that converts letters of a particular text from one language script to another.

The word `Garshoni` is used in Aramaic to refer to the rerendering of a language in a different script than its own. The aim for using the `Garshoni` method is to be able to learn a new script by still using the language known by the learner written by that new script. Aramaics / Syriacs for example used Arabic letters to write Aramaic texts, and they have also used the Syriac script to write Arabic texts. This is however not confined to Arabic and Aramaic/Syriac, but can also extend to other languages and scripts. Therefore, this library, while having Arabic, Syriac and English scripts it enables the user of it to inject new scripts and replacement patterns.
